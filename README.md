## Overview

Surypus is an experimental Haskell ERP/CRM prototype. It focuses on a narrow verifiable core: tax calculations, double-entry accounting, JWT auth with refresh rotation, RBAC, and bill posting.

This repository is not production-ready. The current goal is one green vertical slice, not broad feature coverage.

## Current status

- Prototype stage
- CI: green (one job, GHC 9.6.5, `lts-22.21`)
- Compiling core: `Finance.Tax`, `Finance.Accounting`, `DAL.Types`, `DAL.Schema`, `Surypus.RBAC`, `Surypus.JWT`, `Surypus.Metrics`
- Stack resolver: `lts-22.21`
- GHC: `9.6.5`
- Note: 356 modules quarantined in `src/_quarantine/` — they don't compile and were removed from `exposed-modules`

## Getting started

```bash
stack build
stack test
stack run
```
