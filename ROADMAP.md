# Surypus ERP/CRM - Project Roadmap

## Milestone: v1.0 - Production-ready ERP System

**Status**: Active | **Total Phases**: 8 | **Completed**: 7 | **Remaining**: 1

---

## Phase 1: Core API & Database Integration ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Connect all API handlers to real database operations, remove in-memory stubs
- 1.1: Replace DAL.DB in-memory stubs with real Hasql/PostgreSQL
- 1.2: Connect API.Handlers to DAL.Queries/DAL.Mutations
- 1.3: Implement proper connection pooling (Hasql.Pool)
- 1.4: Remove in-memory DAL.DB completely
- **Success Criteria**: All API handlers use real database, no in-memory stubs remain

---

## Phase 2: JWT Auth & RBAC Middleware ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Production-ready authentication and authorization
- 2.1: JWT middleware with proper token validation
- 2.2: Refresh token rotation with database storage
- 2.3: RBAC middleware enforcing permissions on all write endpoints
- 2.4: Audit logging for all mutations
- **Success Criteria**: All write endpoints protected, RBAC enforced, audit trail working

---

## Phase 3: Bill Posting & Accounting ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Atomic document posting with stock deduction and accounting entries
- 3.1: BillService with atomic transaction (Stock + Accounting)
- 3.2: Property-based testing for double-entry bookkeeping
- 3.2: QuickCheck property tests for invariants
- 3.3: OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generation
- **Success Criteria**: Atomic bill posting, all tests pass, Swagger available

---

## Phase 4: Event Sourcing & Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Event-driven architecture with Event Store, WebSocket broadcasts, Redis queue
- 4.1: Hasql Event Store - Persist events to PostgreSQL with replay capability
- 4.2: Event-Driven Accounting - Translate accounting entries to events
- 4.3: WebSocket Broadcast - Real-time notifications to UI clients
- 4.4: Redis Task Queue - Background report generation and async processing
- **Success Criteria**: Event store operational, WebSocket broadcasts working, Redis queue processing jobs

---

## Phase 5: LiquidHaskell Formal Verification ✅ COMPLETE (Annotations)
**Goal**: Formal verification of critical financial invariants
- 5.1: Annotate Core.Tax with refinement types (VAT ≥ 0, VAT ≤ base) ✅
- 5.2: Annotate Core.Accounting with double-entry invariants (ΣDebit = ΣCredit) ✅
- 5.3: Annotate Inventory.Stock with stock invariants (Rest = Initial + Receipt - Issue) ✅
- 5.4: Configure LiquidHaskell in CI pipeline ⏳ (pending GHC 9.14+)
- **Success Criteria**: LiquidHaskell verification passes in CI, all critical invariants proven

---

## Phase 6: Multi-stage Docker & CI/CD ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Production-ready containerization and deployment pipeline
- 6.1: Multi-stage Dockerfile (builder → runtime with libpq5) ✅
- 6.2: docker-compose.yml for local development (PostgreSQL, Redis, App) ✅
- 6.3: GitHub Actions CI pipeline (build → test → liquid → docker) ✅
- 6.4: Health check endpoint (/health) for container orchestration ✅ (added as WAI middleware)
- **Success Criteria**: Docker image builds, health check passes, CI pipeline green

---

## Phase 7: API Production Hardening ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Production-grade API with observability and resilience
- 7.1: Rate limiting (100 req/min/IP) ✅ (Surypus.API.RateLimiter with sliding window, per-IP/per-tenant)
- 7.2: Prometheus metrics endpoint (/metrics) ✅ (Surypus.Metrics + /api/v1/metrics endpoint)
- 7.3: Structured JSON logging (katip) ✅ (Surypus.API.Logger now uses katip with JSON output)
- 7.4: Circuit breaker for external integrations ⏳ (System.CircuitBreaker exists, needs integration)
- 7.5: Request tracing with correlation IDs ✅ (correlationMiddleware + katip correlation_id in logs)
- 7.6: RateLimit response headers (RateLimit-Limit, RateLimit-Remaining, RateLimit-Reset) ✅ (Surypus.API.RateLimiter adds headers)
- **Success Criteria**: All hardening features operational, metrics exposed

---

## Phase 8: Final Integration & Release v1.0
**Goal**: End-to-end validation and release preparation
- 8.1: Full integration test suite (tmp-postgres in CI)
- 8.2: QuickCheck property tests for all financial invariants
- 8.3: hlint zero warnings
- 8.4: OpenAPI schema validation
- 8.5: Health endpoint returns {status: "ok", db: "ok"}
- 8.6: Release v1.0 tag and Docker image publish
- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass, zero warnings, release artifacts ready
